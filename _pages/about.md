Hello, and welcome to the site! I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Kentucky, and my focus is on microeconomics and public policy. Specifically, my research looks at the implementation of public policy such as Red Flag Laws, Execution Moratoriums, and Zero Dollar Bail. I also enjoy teaching, having experience not only from WVU but also Fairmont State University where I earned my bachelor's degree as well as my MBA. I received my PhD in Economics from West Virginia University in 2023.

I will be on the 2023-24 job market. If you are interested, you can find a copy of my CV [here](/files/CV.pdf).

Job Market Paper: Are Red Flag Laws a green light to save lives?
======
My job market paper examines the impact of state wide red flag laws on homicide rates and suicide rates using a difference-in-differences framework. Mass shootings have become a hot topic of discussion in the United States in recent years. Policymakers have taken action through state legislation to develop a policy intended to reduce the number of mass shootings. Red Flag Laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPO), is a form of gun control policy designed to remove firearms from someone who presents a danger to themselves or others. I find that suicide rates and and homicide rates decrease by just over 6% and 10.4%, respectively in states that have passed and implemented a Red Flag Law. These effects are driven mainly by the states that allow family members as well as law enforcement to petition a state court for the removal of firearms.
