Hello, and welcome to the site! I am currently a fourth year Phd economics student at West Virginia University, and my focus is microeconomics and public policy. I enjoy teaching, having experience not only from WVU but also Fairmont State University where I earned my bachelor's degree as well as my MBA.

Job Market Paper: Are Red Flag Laws a green light to save lives?
======
My job market paper examines the impact of state wide red flag laws on homicide rates and suicide rates using a difference-in-differences framework. Mass shootings have become a hot topic of discussion in the United States in recent years. Policymakers have taken action through state legislation to develop a policy intended to reduce the number of mass shootings. Red Flag Laws, also known as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPO), is a form of gun control policy designed to remove firearms from someone who presents a danger to themselves or others. I find that suicide rates and and homicide rates decrease by just over 6% and 10.4%, respectively in states that have passed and implemented a Red Flag Law. These effects are driven mainly by the states that allow family members as well as law enforcement to petition a state court for the removal of firearms.
