In addition to economics, I've gotten to do a lot of other fun things. I grew up in Doddridge County, WV (if you blink while driving through Doddridge you'll miss it so don't feel guitly if you've never heard of it). I married the love of my life in June 2021 (planning a wedding during grad school as well as a global pandemic makes comps look like cake). I have a boxer, Paisley, named after native West Virginian Brad Paisley, of course. In my free time, I enjoy working out and watching sports, mostly football and basketball both college and professional. As a native West Virginian my heart will always belong to the Mountaineers but I also enjoy watching the New Orleans Saints.
